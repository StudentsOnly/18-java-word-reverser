## Exercise: ArrayList Word Reverser

### Objective:

Practice using ArrayLists to reverse words.

### Description:

You are required to create a program that takes a sentence as input and reverses each word in the sentence using an ArrayList. The program should allow users to input a sentence, reverse the words, display the modified sentence, and exit the program.

### Guidelines:

1.	Create an ArrayList to store words (strings).
2.	Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
3.	Input a sentence
4.	Reverse words
5.	Display modified sentence
6.	Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To input a sentence, take input from the user and split it into words, adding them to the ArrayList.
- To reverse words, iterate through the ArrayList and reverse each word.
- To display the modified sentence, join the words from the ArrayList and print the result.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when handling menu options.
